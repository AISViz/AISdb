üì¢ What is AIS Data?
------------------------

Automatic Identification System (AIS) messages are critical data packets transmitted by vessels and AIS base stations to communicate essential navigational and identification information across the maritime domain. These messages play a significant role in facilitating a safe and efficient flow of marine traffic by ensuring that vessels within proximity know each other's presence, course, and navigational intentions. By providing this vital information, AIS messages are instrumental in enhancing maritime safety, improving navigation efficiency, and strengthening security measures in the maritime domain.

‚û∞ Structured Data Exchange
=====

AIS messages are encoded in a highly structured format and categorized into distinct types, each designed to serve specific informational needs. The most commonly encountered messages in maritime operations include:

- Dynamic Vessel Information: Messages of this type relay real-time navigational status such as vessel position (latitude and longitude), Speed Over Ground (SOG), Course Over Ground (COG), and Heading. These messages are broadcasted with varying frequencies, typically every 2 to 10 seconds for vessels underway and every 3 to 5 minutes for vessels at anchor, ensuring timely updates of vessel movements.
- Static and Voyage-Related Information: Beyond dynamic navigational data, AIS messages also encapsulate static information about the vessel, including Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI), IMO number, vessel name, type, and dimensions. Voyage-related details such as destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and draught are also communicated but are not mandatory.
- Safety-Related Messages: The AIS system also facilitates the transmission of safety and navigational-related messages. These include announcements of navigational hazards, weather conditions, and other urgent safety information crucial for voyage planning and risk mitigation. Usually, it is not available within open-source AIS data.

üåê Encoding and Transmission
=====

The transmission of AIS messages leverages VHF radio frequencies, ensuring broad coverage and reliability even in adverse weather conditions. The encoded format of these messages is standardized to ensure interoperability among various AIS equipment manufacturers and seamless integration with global maritime traffic management systems.

‚öì Significance in Maritime Operations
=====

The strategic importance of AIS messages transcends basic vessel tracking. By providing a detailed, real-time canvas of maritime traffic, AIS messages empower vessel operators, maritime authorities, and traffic management centers to make informed decisions, enhance situational awareness, and proactively address potential navigational hazards. Moreover, the availability of this data has spurred numerous secondary applications, including maritime research, environmental monitoring, and the development of advanced navigational algorithms aimed at optimizing shipping routes and reducing the environmental footprint of maritime operations.

üì¶ Install
-------

To set up AISdb in your environment, follow these commands in your terminal.
This will create a Python virtual environment, activate it, and install AISdb, ensuring that all dependencies are correctly managed within this isolated environment.
This procedure ensures that AISdb and its Python dependencies are contained within a virtual environment, preventing any conflicts with system-wide Python packages.

.. code-block:: sh

    # Create and activate a virtual environment
    python -m venv env_ais
    source env_ais/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env_ais\Scripts\activate`

    # Install AISdb within the virtual environment
    pip install aisdb

üöß Developing
-----------

For developers looking to contribute to AISdb or integrate it into more extensive projects, the development setup is crucial. The following steps outline how to prepare a development environment for AISdb. This includes setting up a virtual environment, activating it, and installing AISdb along with the tools required for development:
These commands facilitate a development environment where changes to the AISdb codebase can be made and tested in real-time. It's essential for developers working on adding features, fixing bugs, or otherwise enhancing the AISdb project.

.. code-block:: sh

    # Create and activate a virtual environment for AISdb development
    python -m venv env_ais_dev
    source env_ais_dev/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env_ais_dev\Scripts\activate`

    # Install AISdb in development mode
    # This typically involves cloning the AISdb repository and installing the package in editable mode
    git clone http://git-dev.cs.dal.ca/meridian/aisdb.git
    cd aisdb

    # Install development dependencies, assuming `requirements-dev.txt` contains them
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

    # Install the AISdb package in editable mode with all extra development dependencies
    pip install -e .[dev]
