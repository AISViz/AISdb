- **Python Interface:** It offers a Python-based API that simplifies interactions with the database, making it accessible for data scientists, researchers, and developers with varying levels of programming expertise.
- **Data Enrichment:** AISdb integrates AIS data with environmental and bathymetric datasets, allowing users to enrich maritime traffic data with contextual information about the marine environment.
- **Advanced Analysis Tools:** The system includes a suite of analysis tools that enable users to perform complex queries, data processing, and statistical analyses directly within the database.
- **Visualization and Export:** AISdb supports data visualization for immediate insight into AIS data and provides functionalities to export data into various formats for further analysis or reporting.

📌 **AISdb is built with a focus on high performance, scalability, and ease of use:**

- **Database Schemas:** Utilizes optimized database schemas for fast data insertion, updates, and complex queries. It supports indexing and partitioning strategies to enhance performance.
- **Data Processing:** Employs Rust for critical data processing tasks, offering unparalleled speed and efficiency. Python wrappers facilitate seamless integration with the Python ecosystem.
- **Flexible Data Import:** Supports importing data from various sources, including live AIS feeds and historical data files. It includes tools for data validation and preprocessing.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Provides a foundation for developing machine learning models by offering clean, processed datasets and the ability to integrate with popular data science libraries.
- **Open Source Collaboration:** Our team encourages community contributions, feature requests, and collaborative development, fostering an ecosystem around maritime data analysis.

📌 **The AISdb visualization module runs locally on the broweser:** *(outdated)*

📢 What is AIS Data?
------------------------

Automatic Identification System (AIS) messages are critical data packets transmitted by vessels and AIS base stations to communicate essential navigational and identification information across the maritime domain. These messages play a significant role in facilitating a safe and efficient flow of marine traffic by ensuring that vessels within proximity know each other's presence, course, and navigational intentions. By providing this vital information, AIS messages are instrumental in enhancing maritime safety, improving navigation efficiency, and strengthening ocean safety.

➰ Structured Data Exchange
=====

AIS messages are encoded in a highly structured format and categorized into distinct types, each designed to serve specific informational needs. The most commonly encountered messages in maritime operations include:

- Dynamic Vessel Information: Messages of this type relay real-time navigational status such as vessel position (latitude and longitude), Speed Over Ground (SOG), Course Over Ground (COG), and Heading. These messages are broadcasted with varying frequencies, typically every 2 to 10 seconds for vessels underway and every 3 to 5 minutes for vessels at anchor, ensuring timely updates of vessel movements.
- Static and Voyage-Related Information: Beyond dynamic navigational data, AIS messages also encapsulate static information about the vessel, including Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI), IMO number, vessel name, type, and dimensions. Voyage-related details such as destination, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and draught are also communicated but are not mandatory.
- Safety-Related Messages: The AIS system also facilitates the transmission of safety and navigational-related messages. These include announcements of navigational hazards, weather conditions, and other urgent safety information crucial for voyage planning and risk mitigation. Usually, it is not available within open-source AIS data.

🌐 Encoding and Transmission
=====

The transmission of AIS messages leverages VHF radio frequencies, ensuring broad coverage and reliability even in adverse weather conditions. The encoded format of these messages is standardized to ensure interoperability among various AIS equipment manufacturers and seamless integration with global maritime traffic management systems.

⚓ Significance in Maritime Operations
=====

The strategic importance of AIS messages transcends basic vessel tracking. By providing a detailed, real-time canvas of maritime traffic, AIS messages empower vessel operators, maritime authorities, and traffic management centers to make informed decisions, enhance situational awareness, and proactively address potential navigational hazards. Moreover, the availability of this data has spurred numerous secondary applications, including maritime research, environmental monitoring, and the development of advanced navigational algorithms aimed at optimizing shipping routes and reducing the environmental footprint of maritime operations.

📦 Install
-------

To set up AISdb in your environment, follow these commands in your terminal:

.. code-block:: sh

    python -m venv AISdb  # Create and activate a virtual environment
    source AISdb/bin/activate  # On Windows use `AISdb\Scripts\activate`
    pip install aisdb  # Install the latest pre-compiled AISdb from PyPI

🚧 Developing
-----------

For developers looking to contribute to AISdb or integrate it into more extensive projects, the following steps outline how to prepare a development environment for AISdb.
This includes setting up a virtual environment, activating it, and installing AISdb along with the tools required for development:

.. code-block:: sh
